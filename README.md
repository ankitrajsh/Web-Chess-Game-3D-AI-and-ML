# Web Chess Game with 3D, AI, and ML

Welcome to the repository for our Web Chess Game, a project that combines stunning 3D graphics, challenging artificial intelligence, and advanced machine learning techniques to deliver an immersive chess playing experience. This game is designed for both beginners and seasoned players who seek to improve their skills by playing against a sophisticated AI or enjoy a visually rich game of chess online.

## Project Overview

This Web Chess Game offers a unique blend of technology and classic chess play, featuring a 3D interactive board, AI opponents with varying levels of difficulty, and an ML-based system that learns from each game to improve its challenge. Whether you're looking to practice, play casually, or face off against a formidable AI, this game provides an engaging platform for all.

## Features

- **3D Chess Board**: A fully interactive 3D board that brings each game to life.
- **AI Opponents**: Multiple levels of AI difficulty, from beginner to expert.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: An ML model that evolves by learning different game strategies and player moves.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Play against friends or online opponents in real-time.
- **Chess Analytics**: Review your games with analytics and insights to improve your strategy.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a seamless experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics in the web browser.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning library for training and deploying models directly in the browser.
- **Stockfish Engine**: Integrated for AI opponent logic.
- **Node.js and Express**: Backend server for managing multiplayer sessions and user data.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing game histories and user profiles.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication in multiplayer games.
